        Well i made it 1200 miles already , and i passed through some interesting places on
        the way:

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <p>
        <blockquote>
         Passing cars, <br>
         When you can 't see,<br>
         May get you, <br>
         A glimpse, Of eternity,<br> 
       </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing 
        any cars.
    </p>

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe i finally got everything packed and ready to go.
        Because i'm on a segway , i wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
        <ul>
        <li> phone </li>
        <li>ipod</li>
        <li>digital camera </li>
        <li>and a protein bar  </li>
        </ul>
        Just the essentials . AS Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway.</q>
